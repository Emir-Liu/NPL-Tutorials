# NPL Tidbits

NPL Constructs are fundamental components in NPL language. To get you familiar with these constructs, we have provided simple and comprehensive construct examples. 

Each construct example is designed to be as simple as possible to focus on  specific construct only. With these simple examples and the steps to verify them, you should be able to experience these constructs quickly.
