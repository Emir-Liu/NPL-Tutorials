# NPL Titbits

NPL Constructs are fundamental components in NPL language. To get you familiar with these constructs, we have provided simple and comprehensive construct examples. 

Each construct example is designed to be as simple as possible to focus on the specific construct only. With the simple examples and the steps to verify them, you should be able to experience these constructs quickly.
